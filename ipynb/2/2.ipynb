In this context, what that means is that **we have some *query* sequence, and we want to know which *reference* sequence in a database it is most similar to**. This could be achieved in a few ways. It could be implemented with local alignment by representing the database as one long sequnence (if we build some functionality to support that into the algorithm), or with local or global alignment (depending on your application) by running our align function many times to search one *query* sequence against many *reference* sequences in the database."
