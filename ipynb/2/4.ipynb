It is widely used, though it's application in phylogenetics is usually restricted to building preliminary trees to \"guide\" the process of multiple sequence alignment, as it makes some assumptions that don't work well for inferring relationships between organsims. We're going to start with it here however for a few reasons. First, the underlying math is very basic, so we don't need to assume anything about your background. Second, there are some other applications of UPGMA that we'll explore later, including grouping samples based on their species compositions. In general, my strategy with teaching this material is to start by giving you a basic introdution into how a process works so you can visualize and do it. From there, we can get more complex."
