For example, if you are trying to gain insight on the evolutionary relationships between all of the 16S bacterial genes in a given sample, it would be time consuming and very inefficient to compare them two at a time. It would be more efficient and useful to compare all of the 16S sequences from the bacteria in the same alignment.\n",

The only change that is necessary is in how the alignment of two non-gap characters is scored. Recall that we previously scored an alignment of two characters by looking up the score of subsitution from one to the other in a substitution matrix. To adapt this for aligning a sequence to an alignment, or for aligning an alignment to an alignment, we compute this subsitution as the average score of aligning the pairs of characters."
