      "A common need in bioinformatics is, given a number of *query* sequences, group them based on their similarity either to one another, or their similarity to sequences in an external reference database, or to both. The most common way to do this is using sequence alignment (you may be noticing a theme here...).\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of searching a set of sequences against a reference database to find their best match is typically referred to a **sequence mapping**. One example of this would be in *genome re-sequencing*. If you're searching for polymorphisms in the human genome that may be associated with a phenotype (e.g., a particular disease) you might begin by sequencing the full human genome. Because the human genome has been fully sequenced and (mostly) assembled, you could map your short sequence reads against the full human genome, and then search for loci (or co-located sets of one or more bases) that vary with the phenotype of interest. Because this process is generally performed with DNA sequencing reads, you may also hear it referred to as *read mapping*.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar process can be applied if there is no reference database to search against. In this case, sequences will be grouped together based on their similarity to one another. This is most often applied to reads of a single gene or locus across the genomes of many different organisms. This process is referred to as **de novo sequence clustering**, and one field where this is common is **microbiomics**, or the study of whole communities of microorganisms. Because we don't know how to culture the vast majority of microbes, most of what we know about the composition of microbial communities (e.g., in free-living environments, such as the ocean, soil, or surfaces in our homes or offices, or in host-associated environments, such as the human gut) is based on sequencing specific marker genes such as the 16S rRNA from all community members. If we obtain a large number of sequence reads, many of the things we want to do with them (such as identify their taxonomic origin, or understand where they fall in a phylogenetic tree) is too computationally intensive to achieve. So instead, we group sequences that are identicial or highly similar in composition into **Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)**, and we choose a single representative of that OTU to work with downstream. For example, if we have a group of 16S rRNA reads that are within 97% identity to one member of that cluster (the cluster centroid) we may assume that the taxonomic origin of the cluster centroid is the same as the taxonomic origin of all of the sequences in the group. This is an *assumption* - it may or may not be true - but it is a necessary evil given the current technology. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another application of grouping similar sequences (or **OTU clustering**, or **OTU picking**, as it is sometimes referred to) is in grouping sequences in a database before investigating them, to reduce taxonomic bias in the database. For example, *E. coli* is one of the most heavily sequenced microbes. If you're interested in understanding the frequency of variants of a specific gene across a range of microbial diversity, you might begin by obtatining all sequences of that gene from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Because there may be many more *E. coli* sequences, purely because of sequencing bias, you'd likely want to group your sequences into OTUs before computing variant frequencies, so your calculations are not biased toward the frequencies in *E. coli*, as hundreds of E. coli sequences would likely group to one or a few closely related OTUs. In other words, you're trying to find a **divergent set** of sequences to work with (and an [aptly named tool](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16769708) was published in 2006 to automate this process).\n",
      "\n",
      "We have learned the key tools we need for both sequence mapping and clustering in previous chapters. **Because the process of read mapping is nearly identical to database searching, in this chapter we'll start by exploring how to perform de novo sequence clustering**. At the end of the chapter we'll look at a case where we combine sequence clustering with sequence mapping, which arose to deal with massive sequence datasets generated in microbiomics.\n",

      "The algorithm at the core of *de novo* clustering is sequence alignment. In an ideal world, we would perform a full multiple sequence alignment with either Smith-Waterman or Needleman-Wunsh of all of our sequences, compute their pairwise similarities (or dissimilarities), and use those values to group sequences that are above some *similarity threshold* into *OTU clusters* (just *OTUs* from here). As we discussed in the mutliple sequence alignment chapter however, that is infeasible for more than a few tens of sequences due to computational and memory requirements. Even progressive alignment can't typically handle more than a few tens of thousands of sequences (at least with the currently available implementations, that I am aware of), so OTU clustering is generally acheived by picking pairs of sequences to align. You'll notice in this section that many of the heuristics that have been applied for speeding up database searching are similar to the heuristics applied for OTU clustering.\n",

Remember that in the multiple sequence alignment chapter we discussed computing *kmer distances* between sequences, which is an alignment-independent way of getting an idea of the similarity of a pair of sequences. Relative to pairwise alignment, this is very fast, so another strategy we can take is to compute all kmer distances between a query sequence and all cluster centroids first. Then, run our centroid clustering process, but only compute the pairwise alignment between a query sequence and the cluster centroid that has the smallest kmer distance to the query. The affect will be that rather than computing the pairwise alignment between a query and all cluster centroids, we only compute the alignment between the query sequence and the cluster centroid that we think is likely to be most similar to the query sequence, based on it having the smallest kmer distance."

      "Up until this point we have focused our discussion on *de novo* OTU clustering, meaning that sequences are clustered only against each other, with no external reference. This is a very widely applied protocol, and the primary function of popular bioinformatics tools such as [cdhit](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/23/3150.long) and [uclust](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/19/2460.long). Another category of OTU clustering protocols is also popular however: reference-based OTU clustering, where a external reference database of sequences is used to aid in cluster defintion. In this section we compare *de novo* clustering with two reference-based OTU clustering protocols, closed-reference and open-reference. \n",

      "De novo OTU clustering\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In a de novo OTU clustering process, as discussed above, reads are clustered against one another without any external reference sequence collection. A benefit of de novo OTU picking is that all reads are clustered. A drawback is that there is no existing support for running this in parallel in QIIME, so it can be too slow to apply to large datasets (e.g., more than 10 million reads). \n",
      "\n",
      "You **must** use de novo OTU picking if:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  You do not have a reference sequence collection to cluster against, for example because you're working with an infrequently used marker gene.\n",
      "\n",
      "You **cannot** use de novo OTU picking if:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  You are comparing non-overlapping loci, such as the V2 and the V4 regions of the 16S rRNA.\n",
      "*  You working with very large data sets, like a full HiSeq 2000 run. (Technically, you can use de novo OTU picking here, but you literally might wait a month or more for your results.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  All reads are clustered\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  Speed. Does not run in parallel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closed-reference OTU clustering (also referred to as *read mapping*)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In a closed-reference OTU clustering process, reads are clustered against a reference sequence collection and any reads which do not hit a sequence in the reference sequence collection are excluded from downstream analyses. \n",
      "\n",
      "You **must** use closed-reference OTU clustering if:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  You are comparing non-overlapping loci, such as the V2 and the V4 regions of the 16S rRNA. Your reference sequences must span both of the regions being sequenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "You **cannot** use closed-reference OTU clustering if:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  You do not have a reference sequence collection to cluster against, for example because you're working with an infrequently used marker gene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  Speed. Closed-reference OTU clustering is fully parallelizable, so is useful for extremely large data sets.\n",
      "*  Better trees and taxonomy. Because all OTUs are already defined in your reference sequence collection, you may already have a tree and a taxonomy that you trust for those OTUs. You have the option of using those, or building a tree and taxonomy from your sequence data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  Inability to detect novel diversity with respect to your reference sequence collection. Because reads that don't hit the reference sequence collection are discarded, your subsequent analyses can only focus on the diversity that you \"already know about\". Depending on how well-characterized the environment that you're working in is, you may end up throwing away a small fraction of your reads (e.g., discarding 1-10% of the reads is common for 16S-based human microbiome studies, where databases like Greengenes cover most of the organisms that are typically present) or a large fraction of your reads (e.g, discarding 50-80% of the reads has been observed for \"unusual\" environments like [the Guerrero Negro microbial mats](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22832344)). \n",
      "\n",
      "Open-reference OTU clustering\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In an open-reference OTU clustering process, reads are clustered against a reference sequence collection and any reads which do not hit the reference sequence collection are subsequently clustered de novo.\n",
      "\n",
      "You **cannot** use open-reference OTU clustering if:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  You are comparing non-overlapping loci, such as the V2 and the V4 regions of the 16S rRNA.\n",
      "*  You do not have a reference sequence collection to cluster against, for example because you're working with an infrequently used marker gene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  All reads are clustered.\n",
      "*  Speed. Open-reference OTU clustering can partially run in parallel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "*  Speed. Some steps of this protocol do still run serially. For data sets with a lot of novel diversity with respect to the reference sequence collection, this can still take days to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "OTU clustering in QIIME\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The [QIIME](www.qiime.org) software package implements these three OTU clustering methods, with some variations on the underlying clustering algorithms that are applied for each. The [QIIME OTU picking tutorial](http://qiime.org/tutorials/otu_picking.html), which this section of this chapter was derived from, covers how to access these different methods.\n"
