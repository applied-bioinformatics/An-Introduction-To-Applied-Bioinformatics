      "One of the most fundamental problems in bioinformatics is determining how \"similar\" a pair of sequences are. There are many applications for this, including determing the function of an unknown gene sequence, determining the source organism of a sequence, developing hypotheses about the relatedness of organisms, or grouping sequences from closely related organisms. On the surface, this seems like a pretty straight-forward problem - not one that would have been at the center of decades of research and the subject of [one of the most cited papers](http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=VRccPlQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=VRccPlQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) in modern biology.\n",

      "This one base change had a big effect on the distance between the two sequences. If this is a protein coding sequence, maybe that's reasonable, but given what we know about how biological sequences evolve this doesn't seem biologically justified. In this case, it seems that an insertion or deletion (i.e., an **indel**) event has shifted one sequence relative to the other, which resulted in many of the bases \"downstream\" of the indel being different. What we'd really want to do is have a way to indicate that an indel seems to have occured in one of the sequences. For example, let's define ``q4``, where we use a ``-`` character to indicate a deletion with respect to ``r1``. This results in what seems like a more reasonable distance between the two sequences (though given what you know about how indel events can disrupt protein coding sequences, you may feel that this distance is too close to the distance between ``r1`` and ``q1``):"

In other words, align one on top of the other, inserting gaps as necessary, in a way that maximizes their similarity.

This has some important specific applications: for example, if we have two full-length protein sequences, and we have a crystal structure for one of them, we may want to have a direct mapping between all positions in both sequences. Probably more common however is local alignment: where we have a pair of sequences that we suspect may partially overlap each other, and we want to know what the best possible alignment of all or part of one sequence is with all or part of the other sequences. Perhaps the most widely used application of this is in the BLAST search algorithm, where we a query sequence and we want to know what the closest match (or matches) are in a reference database containing many different gene sequences. In this case, the whole reference database could be represented as a single sequence, as we could perform a local alignment against it to find the region that contains the highest scoring match. "

      "The second limitation of the our simple alignment algorithm, and one that is also present in our version of Smith-Waterman as implemented above, is that all gaps are scored equally whether they represent the opening of a new insertion/deletion, or the extension of an existing insertion/deletion. This isn't ideal based on what we know about how insertion/deletion events occur (see [this discussion of replication slippage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21114/)). Instead, **we might want to incur a large penalty for opening a gap, but a smaller penalty for extending a gap**. To do this, **we need to make two small changes to our scoring scheme**. When we compute the score for a gap, we should incurr a *gap open penalty* if the previous max score was derived from inserting a gap character in the same sequence. If we represent our traceback matrix as $T$, our gap open penalty as $d^0$, and our gap extend penalty as $d^e$, our scoring scheme would look like the following:\n",
