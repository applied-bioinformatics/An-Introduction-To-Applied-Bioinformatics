@BOOK{Dunn2010-ik,
  title     = "Practical Computing for Biologists",
  author    = "Dunn, Casey and Haddock, Steven HD",
  abstract  = "Increasingly, scientists find themselves facing exponentially
               larger data sets and analyses without suitable tools to deal
               with them. Many biologists end up using spreadsheet programs for
               most of their data-processing tasks and spend hours clicking
               around or copying and pasting, and then repeating the process
               for other data files. Practical Computing for Biologists shows
               you how to use many freely available computing tools to work
               more powerfully and effectively. The book was born out of the
               authors' own experience in developing tools for their research
               and helping other biologists with their computational problems.
               Although many of the techniques are relevant to molecular
               bioinformatics, the motivation for the book is much broader,
               focusing on topics and techniques that are applicable to a range
               of scientific endeavors. Twenty-two chapters organized into six
               parts address these topics and more: Searching with regular
               expressions The Unix command line Python programming and
               debugging Creating and editing graphics Databases Performing
               analyses on remote servers Working with electronics While most
               of the concepts and examples apply to any operating system, the
               main narrative focuses on Mac OS X. Where there are differences
               for Windows and Linux users, parallel instructions are provided
               in the margin and in an appendix. The book is designed to be
               used as a self-guided resource for researchers, a companion book
               in a course, or as a primary textbook. Practical Computing for
               Biologists will free you from the most frustrating and
               time-consuming aspects of data processing so you can focus on
               the pleasures of scientific inquiry.",

              potential interest to those wishing to expand their knowledge of
              bioinformatics and computational biology. The courses are

@BOOK{Felsenstein2003-wm,
  title     = "Inferring Phylogenies",
  author    = "Felsenstein, Joseph",
  abstract  = "Phylogenies (evolutionary trees) are basic to thinking about and
               analyzing differences between species. Statistical,
               computational, and algorithmic work on them has been ongoing for
               four decades, with great advances in understanding. Yet no book
               has summarized this work until now. Inferring Phylogenies
               explains clearly the assumptions and logic of making inferences
               about phylogenies, and using them to make inferences about
               evolutionary processes. It is an essential text and reference
               for anyone who wants to understand how phylogenies are
               reconstructed and how they are used. As phylogenies are inferred
               with various kinds of data, this book concentrates on some of
               the central ones: discretely coded characters, molecular
               sequences, gene frequencies, and quantitative traits. Also
               covered are restriction sites, RAPDs, and microsatellites.
               Inferring Phylogenies is intended for graduate-level courses,
               assuming some knowledge of statistics, mathematics (calculus and
               fundamental matrix algebra), molecular sequences, and
               quantitative genetics.",

  author    = "Durbin, Richard and Eddy, Sean R and Krogh, Anders and
               Mitchison, Graeme",
  abstract  = "Probablistic models are becoming increasingly important in
               analyzing the huge amount of data being produced by large-scale
               DNA-sequencing efforts such as the Human Genome Project. For
               example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological
               sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for
               identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic
               evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from
               different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and
               self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods,
               and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence
               analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is
               accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and
               mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and
               at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and
               important field.",

  abstract = "Online learning initiatives over the past decade have become
              increasingly comprehensive in their selection of courses and
