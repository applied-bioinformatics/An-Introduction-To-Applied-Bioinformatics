# Reading An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics <link src='74cadb'/>

**Bioinformatics, as I see it, is the application of the tools of computer science (things like programming languages, algorithms, and databases) to address biological problems (for example, inferring the evolutionary relationship between a group of organisms based on fragments of their genomes, or understanding if or how the community of microorganisms that live in my gut changes if I modify my diet).** Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field, largely in response to the vast increase in the quantity of data that biologists now grapple with. Students from varied disciplines (e.g., biology, computer science, statistics, and biochemistry) and stages of their educational careers (undergraduate, graduate, or postdoctoral) are becoming interested in bioinformatics.

*An **I**ntroduction to **A**pplied **B**ioinformatics*, or **IAB**, is an open source, interactive bioinformatics text. **It introduces readers to the core concepts of bioinformatics in the context of their implementation and application to real-world problems and data.** IAB is closely tied to the [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org) python package, which provides production-ready implementations of core bioinformatics algorithms and data structures. Readers therefore learn the concepts in the context of tools they can use to develop their own bioinformatics software and pipelines, enabling them to rapidly get started on their own projects. While some theory is discussed, the focus of IAB is on what readers need to know to be effective, practicing bioinformaticians.

IAB is interactive, being **based on IPython Notebooks** which can be installed on a reader's computer or viewed statically online. As readers are learning a concept, for example, pairwise sequence alignment, they are presented with its scikit-bio implementation directly in the text. scikit-bio code is well annotated (adhering to the [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [numpydoc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt) conventions), so readers can use it to assist with their understanding of the concept. And, because IAB is presented as an IPython Notebook, readers can execute the code directly in the text. For example, when learning pairwise alignment, users can align sequences provided in IAB (or their own sequences) and modify parameters (or even the algorithm itself) to see how changes affect the resulting alignments.

IAB is **completely open access**, with all software being BSD-licensed, and all text being licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Only (i.e., CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). All development and publication is coordinated under [public revision control on GitHub](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics).

IAB is also an **electronic-only resource**. There are currently no plans to commercialize it or to create a print version. This means that, unlike printed bioinformatics texts which are generally out of date before the ink dries, IAB can be updated as the field changes.

**The life cycle of IAB is more like a software package than a book.** There will be development and release versions of IAB, where the release versions are more polished but won't always contain the latest content, and the development versions will contain all of the latest materials, but won't necessarily be copy-edited and polished.

We are in the process of developing a **project status page** that will detail the plans for IAB. This will include the full table of contents, and what stage you can expect chapters to be at at different times. You can track progress of this on [IAB #97](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/issues/97).

[My](alias://fedd13) goal for IAB is for it to make bioinformatics as accessible as possible to students from varied backgrounds, and to get more people into this hugely exciting field. I'm very interested in hearing from readers and instructors who are using IAB, so get in touch if you have corrections, suggestions for how to improve the content, or any other thoughts or comments on the text. In the spirit of openness, I'd prefer to be contacted via the [IAB issue tracker](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/issues/). I'll respond to direct e-mail as well, but I'm always backlogged (just ask my students), so e-mail responses are likely to be slower.

I hope you find IAB useful, and that you enjoy reading it!

## Who should read IAB? <link src='976b11'/>

IAB is written for scientists, software developers, and students interested in understanding and applying bioinformatics methods, and ultimately in developing their own bioinformatics analysis pipelines or software.

IAB was initially developed for an undergraduate course cross-listed in computer science and biology with no pre-requisites. It therefore assumes little background in biology or computer science, however some basic background is very helpful. For example, an understanding of the roles of and relationship between DNA and protein in a cell, and the ability to read and follow well-annotated python code, are both helpful (but not necessary) to get started.

In the *Getting started with [Biology](alias://cf88ac) and [Computer Science](alias://6ad7e1)* sections below I provide some suggestions for other texts that will help you to get started.

## How to read IAB <link src='de1bc2'/>

There are two ways to read *An Introduction To Applied Bioinformatics*:

* The *recommended* way is to work with it interactively. You can do this by installing IAB locally. See the [install instructions at readIAB.org](http://readIAB.org).
* The *easiest* way is to view the static notebooks online at [readIAB.org](http://readIAB.org/).  

In both cases you have the option to read the latest development version (i.e., *master* of the GitHub repository) or the latest release version. The lastest development version will have all of the most recent content, but since it hasn't yet been officially released some aspects may be less polished or buggy. The latest release version won't necessarily have the latest content, but it should be more polished and less buggy. If you're reading IAB on your own, I recommend working with the latest development version. If you're teaching a class that uses IAB, you probably should use the latest release version.

IAB is split into four different sections: *Getting started*, *Fundamentals*, *Applications*, and *Wrapping up*. You should start reading IAB by working through the *Getting started* and *Fundamentals* chapters in order. You should then read the *Applications* chapters and *Wrapping up* in any order, based on your own interest.

## Using the IPython Notebook <link src='fdf5dd'/>

IAB is built using the IPython Notebook, an interactive HTML-based computing environment. The main source for information about the IPython Notebook is the [IPython Notebook website](http://ipython.org/notebook). You can find information there on how to use the IPython Notebook, and also on how to set up and run and IPython Notebook server (for example, if you'd like to make one available to your students).

Most of the code that is used in IAB comes from [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org) package, or other python scientific computing tools. You can access these in the same way that you would in a python script. For example:

```python
>>> import skbio
>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> from IPython.core import page
>>> page.page = print
```

We can then access functions, variables, and classes from these modules.

```python
>>> print(skbio.title)
>>> print(skbio.art)
```

We'll inspect a lot of source code in IAB as we explore bioinformatics algorithms. If you're ever interested in seeing the source code for some functionality that we're using, you can do that using IPython's ``psource`` magic.

```python
>>> from skbio.alignment import TabularMSA
>>> %psource TabularMSA.conservation
```

The documentation for scikit-bio is also very extensive (though the package itself is still in early development). You can view the documentation for the `TabularMSA` object, for example, [here](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/latest/generated/skbio.alignment.TabularMSA.html). These documents will be invaluable for learning how to use the objects.

## About the author <link src='fedd13'/>

My name is Greg Caporaso. I'm the primary author of *An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics*, but there are [other contributors](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/graphs/contributors) and I hope that list will grow.

<div style="float: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 200px">
 <img title="The author in Telluride, CO (April, 2015)." style="float: right;" src="https://raw.github.com/caporaso-lab/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/master/book/getting-started/images/greg-in-telluride.png" height=250/>
</div>

I have degrees in Computer Science (B.S., University of Colorado, 2001) and Biochemistry (B.A., University of Colorado, 2004; Ph.D., University of Colorado 2009). Following my formal training, I joined the [Rob Knight Laboratory](http://knightlab.ucsd.edu), then at the University of Colorado, for approximately 2 years as a post-doctoral scholar. In 2011, I joined the faculty at [Northern Arizona University (NAU)](www.nau.edu) where I'm an Assistant Professor in the Biological Sciences department. I [teach](http://www.caporasolab.us/teaching/) one course per year in bioinformatics for graduate and undergraduate students of Biology and Computer Science. I also run a [research lab](http://www.caporasolab.us/) in the [Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics](http://www.mggen.nau.edu/), which is focused on developing bioinformatics software and studying the human microbiome.

I'm not the world expert on the topics that I present in IAB, but I have a passion for bioinformatics, open source software, writing, and education. When I'm learning a new bioinformatics concept, for example an algorithm like pairwise alignment or a statistical technique like Monte Carlo simulation, implementing it is usually the best way for me to wrap my head around it. This led me to start developing IAB, as I found that my implementations helped my students learn the concepts too. I think that one of my strongest skills is the ability to break complex ideas into accessible components. I do this well for bioinformatics because I remember (and still regularly experience) the challenges of learning it, so can relate to newcomers in the field.

I'm very active in open source bioinformatics software development. I am most widely known for my involvement in the development of the [QIIME software package](http://www.qiime.org), and more recently for leading the development of [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org). I am also involved in many other bioinformatics software projects (see my [GitHub page](http://github.com/gregcaporaso)). IAB is one of the projects that I'm currently most excited about, so I truly hope that it's as useful for you as it is fun for me.
